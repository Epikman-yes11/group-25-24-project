        This was my first project that i made using python and pygame
        it was a game where you have to touch the green cube and if 
        you touch the red cube its game over and when you touch green 
        cubes the red ones get bigger so the game becomes harder it was inspired by snake
        the game wasnt good because it was my first time using pygame
        but it was good for a starter like me. And the second project 
        is this website.
